Create a new file and call it Employee.java. Write the code for the Employee class in that file. Then, write a Main.java program that does the following:
- Instantiates an Employee object
- Checks to see if the employee is a member of the “Tech Department”
- Checks to see if the employee has been employed 5 years or more
- If both cases are true, the program should give the employee a 5% raise
- The Employee pay data field should be updated to reflect the increase.
- Print the employee’s previous salary and their newly calculated salary. Print using the getter method for the pay data field.
